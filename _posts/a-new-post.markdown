A couple of years later, it was getting pretty good. :-) So good, in fact, that I was ready to pronounce it finished, and move on to something else. And right about then came an opportunity to turn the tutorial into a book. Since it was already basically done, I figured this would be no problem. I'd just clean up a few spots, add some more exercises, maybe some more examples, a few more chapters, run it by 50 more reviewers...

It took me another year, but now I think it's really really good, mostly because of the hundreds of brave souls who have helped me write it.

What's here on this site is the original tutorial, more or less unchanged since 2004. For the latest and greatest, you'll want to check out the book.
